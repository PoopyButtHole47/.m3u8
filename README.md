# notes

More work is currently being put into the ppv.wtf front because they have a WAY more unique way of storing .m3u8's (real .m3u8 is obfuscated thru VidEmbed, which is probably why they're so keen on everything being through there) and it's way harder.

TNT 403's due to FlowStreams (and then ppv.wtf as it's basically the succesor to flowstreams) using **Flussonic Media Server**, which allows you to require Authorization for files.

This makes sense as ppv.wtf has the highest quality TNT stream I know of, having pure 1920x1080.

EVERYTHING in the "tnt" folder requires authentication, and other channels may have this protection.

NBA TV **exists** (see waw01-1gbe.fscdn.fun/nbatv/preview.jpg), and the URL is **correct**, but can't access it (possibly needs certain referer, 403?)

As of 4-24-25, a **new mirror** has been found for TNT and NBA TV. **jfk01-10gbe.fscdn.fun** has been found, but it is under the same restrictions as **waw01-1gbe.fscdn.fun**. From info I have gathered, it only has TNT and NBA TV. **cph01-10gbe.fscdn.fun** has been found aswell, but currently no URLs have been found for it.

As of 4-25-25, ppv.wtf cucked the ESPN stream LMFAO fuck you too mark cuckerburg

*We aren't 100% sure yet how wearechecking.xyz categorizes channels, stay with us lmao
